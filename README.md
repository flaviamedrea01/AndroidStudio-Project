# PDM-Project
Abstract
   “Move” is an app for android devices and it is providing information about sports being dedicated to sport enthusiasts or people who want to step into the world of movement.

Utility of the project and target group
   This project is designed to help people find new sports to try or help those who want to add movement to their life find a suitable activity. It targets a wide range of ages because sports can benefit anyone who wants to do physical activity.

Introduction
   What makes “Move” unique is the way it is centered around the sport itself and its benefits unlike other similar apps such as Yahoo Sports, which contains more posts about the famous people who play the sport rather than the beauty of the sport.

After you log in the MainActivity page will open and you can see posts about sports. You can like them and clicking on those three dots will take you to Google to find out more about that sport. If you type inside the search bar it will take you to Google. Pressing the log out button will take you back to the LogIn page.

Application/program structure
   For sing up and log in I used SQL and a database to store the information. I connected it with XAMPP using the Apache and MySQL modules. The programming language used for this application is Java. I have 5 classes: MainActivity, LogIn, SignUp, SetData and MyAdapter. The class SetData is used to store data about each post inside the app: title, description, image. The methods that belong to this class are getTitle(), getDescription(), getImage() which return the title, description and image.

Improvements and extensions
   An improvement I would like to make in the future is adding a comment section so the users can interact. Also, I would love to add a quiz that helps you find which sport suits you best.

Conclusions
   If you need a new sport to try “Move” is the right app for that. Being easy to use it fits most group ages.
